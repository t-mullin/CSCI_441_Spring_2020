## Controls
The controls to navigate the maze are as follows:

In Perspective View:
* `w`: moves in the direction the character is facing
* `s`: move in the opposite direction the character is facing 
* `a`: rotates the character counter clockwise
* `d`: rotates the character clockwise
* `up arrow`: pans the camera up
* `down arrow`: pans the camera down
* `spacebar`: switches to birds eye view

## Acknowledgements:
To generate a random maze, I followed the maze tutorial below. 
The tutorial used an add-on that made generating the maze within a few
simple steps.

* [MeshMaze Blender Add-on](https://github.com/elfnor/mesh_maze)

I wanted to make the maze look like it was from a video game from ages ago. 
To make the textures for the maze walls and the path, I followed 
the tutorial below to make a texture that looks good when tiled.
Unfortunately, the UVs of the maze cause the texture for the hedge 
to be a bit stretched.
