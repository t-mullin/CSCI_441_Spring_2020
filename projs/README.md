# Projects

The projects will give you the opportunity to apply what you learned in the labs
and build something a little larger.  Please feel free to be creative and play
around with the ideas that we are working on in the course.

## Submission

When submitting the projects please tag the commit with the name of the assignment.
E.g. `proj01`
Please make sure to use TWO digits for the number of the project. For
more on tagging commits, see [tagging
tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/inspecting-a-repository/git-tag).
