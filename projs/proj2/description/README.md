# Project 2:

This project implements a ray tracer with anti-aliasing and reflections.

## Notes:
To change the number of samples for anti-aliasing, change the `numSamples` variable in the renderer method.

To change the number of reflections, change the `recursionDepth` variable in the shader method.

A render @ 1920x1080 with 8x anti-aliasing samples and 1x reflection depth takes about 1.5 hours on a AMD FX-8350 processor.
